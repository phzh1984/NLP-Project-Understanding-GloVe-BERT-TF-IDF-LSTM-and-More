# NLP-Project-Understanding-GloVe-BERT-TF-IDF-LSTM-and-More

This project is an exploration of various NLP techniques and models, including GloVe, BERT, TF-IDF, LSTM, and more. To make it easier to navigate, I've organized the project into distinct sections, each addressing a specific aspect of NLP. 

Loading Data

In this section, you'll learn how to load and prepare the dataset for NLP analysis. Proper data preparation is fundamental for successful NLP tasks.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is the starting point in understanding your dataset. You'll explore data distribution, key statistics, and patterns in the text data.

Data Preprocessing

Text data often needs cleaning and transformation. This section covers various preprocessing techniques, including:

Cleaning the Corpus: Removing irrelevant or noisy information from the text.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
Combining Preprocessing Steps: Streamlining the preprocessing workflow.
Target Encoding: Preparing the target variable for modeling.

Tokens Visualization
Visualizing tokens is essential to understand the most common words and their distribution within the text.

Vectorization
This section focuses on converting text data into numerical form, a critical step for machine learning models. The techniques covered include:

Fine-Tuning CountVectorizer: Configuring the count vectorizer.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A technique for numerical representation of text.
Word Embeddings: GloVe: Leveraging pre-trained word embeddings for richer text representation.

Modeling
Building and evaluating NLP models is a central aspect of this project. You'll find implementations of the following models:

Naive Bayes with Document-Term Matrix (DTM): A straightforward yet effective text classification model.
Naive Bayes with TF-IDF: Combining TF-IDF vectorization with Naive Bayes for classification.
XGBoost: A robust gradient boosting algorithm for NLP tasks.

LSTM
This section introduces you to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a powerful architecture for sequence modeling and NLP tasks.

BERT
Explore Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a state-of-the-art model capable of a wide range of NLP tasks.

NLP: Disaster Tweets
This practical application focuses on identifying disaster-related tweets. It includes:

EDA: Analyzing the dataset to understand its characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Preparing text data for modeling.
WordCloud Visualization: A visual representation of word frequencies.
Modeling: Building machine learning models for disaster tweet classification.
GloVe â€“ LSTM Fusion: Combining GloVe word embeddings with LSTM for improved results.
Feel free to explore each section, adapt the code, and use the techniques in your own NLP projects. My hope is that this project will serve as a comprehensive guide to NLP techniques and models, helping you dive into the fascinating world of natural language processing.
